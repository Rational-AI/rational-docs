# Integrating external data

This guide explains how to connect Rational AI to external platforms (such as Google, AWS, or OpenAI) and synchronize their data using connectors and sources.   
The process consists of two steps:

1. **Create and authorize a connector** to access an external provider;
2. **Define a source** that uses the connector to retrieve data.

Both steps are _required_ for the platform to securely access and synchronize external content.

## Establishing the connector
Connectors handle authentication and permissions for external services. To manage connectors open the **Settings** and navigate to **Connectors** from the left-hand sidebar.

<img
  src={require('@site/static/img/screens/connectors-view.png')}
  alt="Dashboard interface displaying the Connectors page."
  style={{ 
    width: '100%', 
    maxHeight: '100%', 
    objectFit: 'contain',
    border: '1px solid #E4E4E7',
    borderRadius: '6px',
    boxSizing: 'border-box',
    }}
/> 

The connectors page is divided into two sections:
1. **Left panel**: a list of all configured connectors.
2. **Right panel**: details of the selected connector, including:
    * Name and description
    * Provider
    * Next scheduled synch
    * Usage by AI models, sources, and tools.

    Some providers (for example, Google) also display enabled services and linked projects.

### Creating a new connector
If no connectors are configured, the page will be empty. To start, simply click the **+ Add** button and select a provider from the available catalog (e.g., Google, AWS, OpenAI).
Each provider has specific authentication requirements. Some providers require only an API key, while others, such as Google, use a full OAuth authorization flow.

Each configuration modal includes a link to a guide for obtaining the required credentials.

After selecting a provider, you will be presented with a configuration form. 
You must provide:
* A **name** (e.g., _Admin Google access_);
* A **description**, optional but **strongly recommended** for long term maintenance and team collaboration;
* **Credentials** obtained from the provider (key, tokens, or OAuth configuration);
When finished click **Add**. The connector will appear in the list on the left.

Some providers require additional configuration steps or authorization flows.
Consult the **provider-specific guides** to learn how to add each one from start to finish.

### Authentication issues 
If authentication fails or permissions are incomplete, a red broken-link icon <img

  alt="Broken chain link icon, indicating an authentication error or disconnected access."
  style={{ 
    width: '1.5em', 
    maxHeight: '1.5em', 
    objectFit: 'contain',
    border: '1px solid #E4E4E7',
    borderRadius: '6px',
    boxSizing: 'border-box',
    verticalAlign: 'middle',
    }}
/>  will appear next to the connector name. 

To resolve the issue:
1. Open the connector’s option menu;
2. Select **Complete authentication**;
3. Repeat the authorization process.

Always resolve authentication errors before creating sources.

## Adding a data source
Once a connector is active, you can define one or more sources to specify which data should be retrieved and synchronized. 
Navigate to **Sources** in the left-hand sidebar and click the **+ New** button.

### Creating a source
In the source creation form, provide the following information:
* A **name** (es. _Marketing assets 2024_);
* A **description** explaining the content and purpose for long term maintenance and team collaboration;
* Select the source type (es. Google Drive);
* Choose a compatible connector and pick the one created in the previous phase.  
    Because the connector is already authenticated, the system will allow you to browse available resources. Select the folders you wish to synchronize.
    
    <Admonition type="warning" icon="⚠️" title="WARNING">  
    If a connector with authentication issues has been selected, it won't be able to access external data and no folder will be available for selection. Return to the **Connectors** page and re-authenticate before continuing.
    </Admonition>

* Click **Add** to confirm.

### Configuring synchronization settings
By default, new sources are created with manual synchronization. You can freely change this from the **Synchronization settings** (available in the <img
  src={require('@site/static/img/screens/more-vert.png')}
  alt="Three vertical dots icon that opens a menu with additional options."
  style={{ 
    width: '1.5em', 
    maxHeight: '1.5em', 
    objectFit: 'contain',
    border: '1px solid #E4E4E7',
    borderRadius: '6px',
    boxSizing: 'border-box',
    verticalAlign: 'middle',
    }}
/>  options menu).

You can choose between two modes:
* **Manual**: synchronization only occurs when triggered manually.
* **Periodic**: data is synchronized automatically at scheduled intervals.
<!-- * **Instantaneous**: changes are automatically synchronzed in near real time on source change. -->

For periodic synchronization, you can define a schedule, such as: every number of minutes, every hour, once a day, once a week, once a month.  
Choose a frequency based on how often your external data changes.

You must also define how deletions are handled:
* **Cascade delete**: files deleted from the original source (e.g., from Google Drive) are also removed from the Rational AI.
* **Keep**: deleted external files remain stored in Rational AI.


## Integrating AWS data
To integrate your application with Amazon S3, you must first establish a secure connection. 
This is done by generating a pair of security credentials (keys) that act like a username and password for your automated processes.

### Generate IAM Credentials
Before configuring the connector, you need an **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** user with the correct permissions.
* **Sign in** to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and navigate to **IAM Dashboard > Users**. 
* **Create a new user**: 
    * Click **Create user**.
    * Under **Permissions options**, select **Attach policies directly**. 
    * Search for and check `AmazonS3FullAccess` (or a more restricted policy if required).  
* **Create Access keys**:
   * Click username of newly created user.
   * **Security credentials > Access keys** and click **Create access key**.
   * Select `Application running outside AWS` as the use case.   
* You will see your **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**. Download the `.csv` file

<Admonition type="warning" icon="⚠️" title="WARNING">  
THe Secret Access Key is **only shown once**. If lost, you must delete the old key and create a new one.
</Admonition>


### Configure the connector
Now that you have your credentials, set up the AWS connector in Rational AI.

* Navigate to **Settings** and select **Connectors** from the left sidebar.
* Add a new connector: Click the **+ Add** button and select **AWS** from the list of available providers.
* Fill out the configuration form:
    * **Name** (e.g., S3 Access for Marketing Data).
    * **Description** (optional but strongly reccomended).
    * **Access Key ID**: paste the public key generated in Step 1.
    * **Secret Access Key**: paste the pricate key.
    * Click **Add** to save and activate the connector.
      
The AWS S3 connector is now **ready for use**. You can link it to specific buckets in the next step.

### Configure the AWS S3 source
After configuring the connector, you need to define the source to specify which S3 buckets should be synchronized.
* Navigate to **Sources** and click **+ New**.
* Select the **AWS connector** you created earlier.
* Fill out the source form:
    * **Name** (e.g., S3 Log Bucket).
    * **Description** to explain the content.
    * **Source type*: select `AWS S3`.
    * **Specify** the AWS **region** where the bucket is located (e.g., eu-central-1).	
    *	**S3 Endpoint** is usually s3.amazonaws.com or a region-specific endpoint.
*	The system will allow you to **browse the S3 buckets accessible** via the selected connector:
    * Select the buckets and, optionally, define specific prefixes/paths within those buckets that you wish to include in the synchronization.
* Click **Add** to create the source.

<Admonition type="info" icon="ℹ️" title="REMEMBER:">  
This source, like all sources, is created with **manual synchronization** by default. Check the [Synchronization settings section](#configuring-synchronization-settings) to learn how to update them.
