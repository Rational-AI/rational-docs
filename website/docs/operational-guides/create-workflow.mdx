# Creating a workflow
This guide explains how to create, configure, and manage workflows in the AI Control Room. 

import Admonition from "@theme/Admonition";

<Admonition type="info" icon="📖" title="GLOSSARY">  
What is a [`workflow?`](#)  
A workflow is a structured set of rules and logic that defines _how data is processed_. 
It is the operational core of your automation: it connects inputs, intelligence, and actions into a single, reusable process.
</Admonition>

To start working with workflows, open the **Settings** area and navigate to **Workflows** from the left sidebar.
This page is the central workspace for creating and managing all your workflows (and processing rules as we will see later).

## Understanding the interface
The workflow page is divided into two main areas: the workflow list and the workflow editor.

### Workflow list
The left panel displays all workflows that have been created in your environment.
For each workflow, you can see:
* The workflow name.
* An enable/disable toggle.

This list gives you a high-level view of which processes are active and which aren’t.

### Workflow editor
When you select a workflow from the list, its details are displayed on the right side. This is where you define how your workflow behaves.

The editor includes:
* The workflow name and description.
* The editable logic or configuration area (JSON or script-based input).
* An action menu that allows you to:
    * Open the workflow in the Lab.
    * Edit its logic.
    * Delete the workflow.


## Creating your first workflow
If you’re a new user, the workflow page may initially be empty. In this case, you can create your first workflow in a few simple steps.

* Click the **+ New** button in the center of the page.
* Enter a clear and descriptive name.  
    Example: _PDF processing workflow_.
* Optionally, add a short description explaining the purpose of the workflow.  
    This is strongly recommended for long-term maintainability.
* Enable your workflow from the list and you’re done. 

## Logic

Let's create a simple, yet effective, workflow that takes as input a lorem-ipsum markdown file, creates a Rational Resource associated with it
and performs chunking and embedding automatically, to allow semantic retrieval in a RAG scenario.

The workflow business logic is defined as below:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# dependencies = [
#     "rational-client",
# ]
#
# ///

from rational_client.core import (
    Knowledge,
    SyncedResource,
)
from rational_client.utils import run


def process(document: SyncedResource, options: dict):
    # Read document content (bytes)
    content = document.get_data()

    # Convert to string (assumes content is textual)
    text = content.decode("utf-8")
    
    # Obtain the Knowledge instance
    knowledge = Knowledge(document.knowledge_id)

    # Create a new Rational Resource in the Knowledge
    new_resource = knowledge.create_resource(
        name=document.name,
        category="document_category",
        tags=["some", "tags"],
        synced_resource_id=document.id,
    )

    # Return the content for chunking and embedding (optional)
    return {str(new_resource.resource_id): text}


run(process)
```

Let's break it down:
- the workflow starts with an incipit which species the script dependencies (in the PEP 723 format): this allows to specify arbitrary script dependencies in your workflow, no whitelisted packages!
- at the bottom we can find the workflow entrypoint, the `run(process)` function, which is an utility function to invoke the `process` function defined
- the workflow business logic is specified in the `process` function: it takes as input the document over which the workflow is applied, and some options that might be used to store values later used in the workflow code
- the workflow typically might invoke operation on Rational AI through the `rational-client` package, such as retrieving a Knowledge handle, i.e. `knowledge = Knowledge(document.knowledge_id)`
- the workflow might return a dictionary specifying the Rational Resources created and their textual content, i.e. text/markdown, to be automatically chunked and embedded according to the Knowledge settings


# TODO
1. Explain workflow entrypoint:

    Create an "Hello world" workflow that creates a Rational Resource in a Knowledge using the [rational-client](https://github.com/Rational-AI/rational-client) python package

    It takes a SR as input and creates a rational resource and return its content

2. PDF processing Example: Docling example for PDFs

3. Test your workflow locally: how to specify a `workflow_input.json` file to test your workflow
