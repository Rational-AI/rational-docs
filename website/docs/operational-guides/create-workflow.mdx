# Creating a workflow
This guide explains how to create, configure, and manage workflows in the AI Control Room. 

import Admonition from "@theme/Admonition";

<Admonition type="info" icon="📖" title="GLOSSARY">  
What is a [`workflow?`](#)  
A workflow is a structured set of rules and logic that defines _how data is processed_. 
It is the operational core of your automation: it connects inputs, intelligence, and actions into a single, reusable process.
</Admonition>

To start working with workflows, open the **Settings** area and navigate to **Workflows** from the left sidebar.
This page is the central workspace for creating and managing all your workflows (and processing rules as we will see later).

## Understanding the interface
The workflow page is divided into two main areas: the workflow list and the workflow editor.

### Workflow list
The left panel displays all workflows that have been created in your environment.
For each workflow, you can see:
* The workflow name.
* An enable/disable toggle.

This list gives you a high-level view of which processes are active and which aren’t.

### Workflow editor
When you select a workflow from the list, its details are displayed on the right side. This is where you define how your workflow behaves.

The editor includes:
* The workflow name and description.
* The editable logic or configuration area (JSON or script-based input).
* An action menu that allows you to:
    * Open the workflow in the Lab.
    * Edit its logic.
    * Delete the workflow.


## Creating your first workflow
If you’re a new user, the workflow page may initially be empty. In this case, you can create your first workflow in a few simple steps.

* Click the **+ New** button in the center of the page.
* Enter a clear and descriptive name.  
    Example: _PDF processing workflow_.
* Optionally, add a short description explaining the purpose of the workflow.  
    This is strongly recommended for long-term maintainability.
* Enable your workflow from the list and you’re done.
