# Create a processing rule
This guide explains how to create, configure, and manage processing rules in the AI Control Room. 

import Admonition from "@theme/Admonition";

What is a [`processing rule?`](#)  
Processing rules define how incoming data is interpreted, validated, filtered, and transformed before or during workflow execution.
While workflows describe _how_ a process runs, processing rules define _how data is evaluated and controlled within that process_.
</Admonition>

To manage processing rules, open the **Settings** area and navigate to **Workflows** from the left sidebar. 
Then switch to the **Processing rules** tab from the top-left section of the page.

## Understanding the interface
The Processing Rules page follows the same structure as the workflows section and is divided into two main areas.

### Rules list
The left panel displays all processing rules that have been created.
For each rule, you can see:
* The rule name.
* An enable/disable toggle.

This list allows you to quickly identify which rules are active and which are currently inactive.

### Rule editor
When you select a rule, its configuration is displayed in the editor on the right side.

The editor includes:
* The rule name and description.
* The editable logic or configuration area (JSON or script-based input).
* An action menu that allows you to:
    * Edit the rule details (name, description, and logic).
    * Delete the rule.

## Creating your first processing rule
If you’re a new user, the page will appear empty. In this case, you can create your first rule in a few simple steps.
* Click the **+ New** button in the center of the page.
* Enter a clear and descriptive name.  
    Example: _Lorem ipsum_
* Optionally, add a short description explaining the rule’s purpose and scope.  This is strongly recommended for long-term maintainability.
* Define the rule logic in the JSON or configuration input area.

Once these fields are filled, you can proceed to enabling and testing the rule.
