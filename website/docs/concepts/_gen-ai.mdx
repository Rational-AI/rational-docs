# Generative AI
**Generative AI** (GenAI) is a core technology in modern AI-driven applications. 
It refers to a class of artificial intelligence systems **designed to create new content**, such as text, images, code, audio, video, and synthetic data, 
rather than only analyzing or classifying existing data.

It is based primarily on deep learning models trained on large datasets. 
Unlike traditional software systems that operate on predefined rules, Generative AI systems learn the statistical structure of language, 
images, and other modalities, and use this knowledge to generate original outputs.
  
#### Comparative view  
| Aspect          | Traditional LLM | Generative AI           |  
|:----------------|:---------------|:-------------------------|  
| Output          | Prediction      | Content creation        |  
| Scope           | Narrow          | General-purpose         |
| Data            | Structured      | Mostly unstructured     |
| Adaptability    | Limited         | High                    |
| Interaction     | Indirect        | Natural language        |

#### Operational principle
Generative AI models analyze large volumes of data during training to learn how information is typically structured. 
When prompted, they generate outputs by estimating the most probable continuation based on learned patterns.
