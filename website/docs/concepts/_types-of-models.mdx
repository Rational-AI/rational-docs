# Types of models
In Rational AI you can add three types of models: Fine-tuned, Open source and Third party.

## 1) Fine-tuned model

A model that’s been **trained further on your own data** (or a specific dataset) to behave a certain way—tone, domain knowledge, formats, policies, etc.

* **Best for:** consistent behavior for a specific use case (support, internal tooling, company style).
* **What you usually manage:** which fine-tune to use, and its base model lineage.

## 2) Open source model

A model you **download and run yourself** (commonly from Hugging Face), often as a local file format like GGUF with a chosen quantization.

* **Best for:** running on your own infrastructure, cost control, offline/air-gapped use, customization.
* **Tradeoffs:** you own the hosting + compute + storage; model sizes can be large.

## 3) Third-party model (proxy)

A model that’s **hosted by an external provider** (e.g., OpenAI / Anthropic / Google). Your platform stores a configuration that routes requests to that provider.

* **Best for:** fast setup, strong quality, no hosting burden.
* **Key concept:** you don’t “install” the model; you configure access (provider + model + key) and your platform talks to their API.
