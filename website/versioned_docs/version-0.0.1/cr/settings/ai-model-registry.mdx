# AI Model Registry

It’s a central “catalog” of the AI models your can use in Rational AI. You add models once, and use them consistently (chat, agents, tools, workflows, etc.). It also lets you control which models are available, see key info (size, type, updates), and manage changes over time.

  <div className="featureBox__title">Who can use this feature</div>

  <div className="featureBox__row">

      Available on <a href="/pricing">any plan</a>

## Add models
In Rational AI you can add three types of models: Fine-tuned, Open source and Third party. See [Types of model](concepts/types-of-models.mdx) page for more information.

### Add a fine-tuned model

* Choose **Fine-tuned model**
* Pick one from your fine-tuned list
* Review the metadata shown (architecture, parameters, quant/type/size if applicable)
* Click **Add**

### Add an open source model
To add an Open source model 
* Choose **Open source model** from the add model modal
* Search/select the model you want
* Double-check **size** and **quantization** (these directly affect RAM/disk + speed/quality)
* Click **Add** to install

### Add a third-party proxy model

* Choose **Proxy to a commercial model**
* Fill in:

  * **Model name** (how it appears in your platform)
  * **Description** (optional but useful)
  * **Provider**
  * **API key**
  * **Provider model** (the exact model you want to call)
* Click **Confirm**
* Save the generated **secret key** somewhere safe (it’s shown once) and note the **endpoint**

## Manage models

### Edit

Use this when you want to rename, update description, or adjust config (especially common for proxy models if you switch provider models or rotate keys).

### Delete

Removes the model from availability in the platform. Use this when a model is retired, replaced, or no longer approved.

##  Cost metering
### Enable cost metering (toggle)

Turns cost tracking on/off for the selected model.

On: the model can participate in spend reporting of Goverance module.

Off: the model still works, but Rational is not tracking costs for it.

### Cost type

There are two types of cost Fixed monthly ... FIXME
